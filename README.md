About These Scripts:
All PowerShell scripts in this repository were written by me in pursuit of making certain tasks simpler. I apologize in advance for any odd or unconventional code you may encounter in my earlier scripts. Please note that I have not maintained the vast majority of these scripts, so they may not reflect my current coding practices or skill level. 

Attribution:
If you find any code in this repository that is yours and I have not properly credited you, please let me know, and I will correct it as soon as possible. As I revisit these scripts, I will make every effort to add proper credit where I can remember the source of the code or concepts.
