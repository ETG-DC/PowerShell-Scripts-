About These Scripts
All PowerShell scripts in this repository were written by me from the very beginning of my journey in scripting. I apologize in advance for any odd or unconventional code you may encounter in my earlier scripts. 
Please note that I have not maintained the vast majority of these scripts, so they may not reflect my current coding practices or skill level. Some of them might make you laugh or say what the fu- but it was necessary

Attribution
If you find any code in this repository that is yours and I have not properly credited you, please let me know, and I will correct it as soon as possible. As I revisit these scripts, I will make every effort to add proper credit where I can remember the source of the code or concepts.
